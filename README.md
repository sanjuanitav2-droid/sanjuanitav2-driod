### Decision Tree Classifier for Loan Acceptance Prediction

I just wrapped up a machine learning project where I built and optimized a Decision Tree Classifier to predict customer loan acceptance.

Key steps included:
- ✅ Data preprocessing (fixing errors, handling redundancy, dropping irrelevant features)
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (correlations, outliers, categorical insights)
- ✅ Model building with pre-pruning and post-pruning to balance accuracy and interpretability
- ✅ Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, and Balanced Accuracy
- ✅ Clear business insights — higher income, credit card spending, and advanced education strongly drive loan acceptance.

### K-Fold Cross Validation for Model Tuning

I recently completed a hands-on notebook where I explored and implemented K-Fold Cross Validation for model evaluation and tuning, using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

Key steps included:
- ✅ Data preparation and feature overview  
- ✅ Splitting the data into training and testing sets  
- ✅ Applying K-Fold Cross Validation to assess model stability and performance  
- ✅ Building and evaluating a Logistic Regression model across multiple folds  
- ✅ Interpreting accuracy metrics and understanding model variability

### Boosting & XGBoost Regression: Bike Sharing Case Study

I just completed an end-to-end case study where I used advanced ensemble and boosting techniques (including XGBoost) to predict bike rental demand for a bike-sharing company.

Key steps included:
- ✅ Exploratory data analysis to uncover impactful features
- ✅ Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- ✅ Building regression models with Bagging, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Stacking, and XGBoost
- ✅ Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- ✅ Evaluating model performance to drive actionable business recommendations
