### Decision Tree Classifier for Loan Acceptance Prediction

I just wrapped up a machine learning project where I built and optimized a Decision Tree Classifier to predict customer loan acceptance.

Key steps included:
- ‚úÖ Data preprocessing (fixing errors, handling redundancy, dropping irrelevant features)
- ‚úÖ Exploratory Data Analysis (correlations, outliers, categorical insights)
- ‚úÖ Model building with pre-pruning and post-pruning to balance accuracy and interpretability
- ‚úÖ Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, and Balanced Accuracy
- ‚úÖ Clear business insights ‚Äî higher income, credit card spending, and advanced education strongly drive loan acceptance.
